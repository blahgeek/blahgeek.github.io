I'm 赵一开, a developer (hence the domain, z1k.dev).

I'm also known as `blahgeek` in many websites.
(I chose this username many years ago because I considered myself a boring geek;
I'm still using it because it's a rare name without duplications across the Internet.)

I'm a proud Arch Linux user and Emacs user (with evil-mode).
I run my own network [AS208679](https://bgp.he.net/AS208679).

I currently work for [Pony.ai](https://pony.ai/) in Beijing, China.

Contact me on [yikai@z1k.dev](mailto:yikai@z1k.dev?subject=Hello),
preferably using my [GPG key](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xa74af69a8cc3b7f228fa30746d7ec222c6de82bf).
Also find me in [Github](https://github.com/blahgeek) or [Wechat](https://blog.blahgeek.com/images/weixin-qr.png).

This website used to contain some old blog posts but
I decided it's not worth it to maintain or keep them (at least not in the frontpage).
You may still find them [here](https://blog.blahgeek.com/all/).
