I have been asking myself: Why write a blog?

One reason is that I want to share things I found insteresting or useful with others,
someone like me. But then it occurred to me, someone like me would never
search tech stuffs in Chinese. At least I never did that. Chinese Internet is
full of garbage.

Another reason is that I thought I would find it pleasing. But actually I was not.
I don't like writing in Chinese, at all. Though my English is not that good, I like
reading and writing English more than Chinese.

So I'm going to write tech stuffs in English as much as possible.
